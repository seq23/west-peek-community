    <h2>What West Peek is</h2>
    <p>
      West Peek is the umbrella community behind West Peek Ventures and West Peek Productions.
      It exists to connect thoughtful founders, operators, and investors before things are obvious.

    <h2>What’s coming</h2>
    <p>
      A podcast, small events, and a newsletter focused on building companies with clarity and trust.
      This site is intentionally simple while those pieces come together.
    </p>
    <p>
      For now, content lives on existing channels and in direct conversations.
