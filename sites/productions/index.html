        <h3>Before the event</h3>
        <p>
          Platform selection, technical planning, rehearsals, and speaker preparation.
          We design the system so nothing feels improvised on the day of the event.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>During the event</h3>
        <p>
          Live production, visuals, graphics, audio, camera direction, and real‑time troubleshooting.
          Our role is to keep things calm and invisible.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>After the event</h3>
        <p>
          Recordings, post‑event assets, follow‑ups, and debriefs so one event becomes long‑term leverage.
