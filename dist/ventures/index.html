      <p>West Peek Ventures partners with founders early, before growth is obvious to everyone. We believe trust is the new moat — and community is the catalyst.</p>

  <h2>What we believe</h2>
  <p>In a world where software and capital are increasingly abundant, trust is scarce. We believe the strongest companies are built inside trusted networks — long before they are obvious to the market.</p>

  <div class="card-grid">
    <div class="card">
